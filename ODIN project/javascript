when using the + symbol, anything right of a string will cause all things to be treated as a string right of the "". And anything attached to it. 
this only applies to the + symbol.
0xFF will be like 16 * 16, like the colors ff00ff. 
strings are words
numbers are numbers
objects name:value pair. 
Objects can be created with new name(value), but slows down the process, do avoid. 
type of variable, to see what type it is.
Number(variable) to turn a string into a number
or, parse int, or even better, just add a +variable and that works the same as Number(variable)
++ var vs var++, var++ uses the old value and needs to be called again to see the new one, ++var gives you the new one straight up.
----------STRINGS
null means simply value is not there, we give that to a variable to say we don't know. 
We learned Number(var) makes a string into a number, to make a number into a string we do var.toString().
indexOf("word") finds the first place it can be seen, .length returns the length., .search(words)[cannot take position] works the same as indexOf(word,15).
for slice, we need to set it to another var. Best to treat all of them this way. 
replace(word want to be replace, word going to be added)./same words wanted to be replace /g
-------------CONDITIONALS
IF statements make a condition if true run somethng, ELSE is done if it's false, ELSE IF is when IF is false, but meets another condition.
&& returns the first false, while || returns the first truth. ! makes booleans oppsite values, while !! makes thing into booleans. 

Example of DOM and switch statement

const select = document.querySelector('select');
const para = document.querySelector('p');

select.addEventListener('change', setWeather); ("change will be the value, setWeather is the function)


function setWeather() {
  const choice = select.value;

  switch (choice) {
    case 'sunny':
      para.textContent = 'It is nice and sunny outside today. Wear shorts! Go to the beach, or the park, and get an ice cream.';
      break;
    case 'rainy':
      para.textContent = 'Rain is falling outside; take a rain coat and an umbrella, and don\'t stay out for too long.';
      break;
    case 'snowing':
      para.textContent = 'The snow is coming down â€” it is freezing! Best to stay in with a cup of hot chocolate, or go build a snowman.';
      break;
    case 'overcast':
      para.textContent = 'It isn\'t raining, but the sky is grey and gloomy; it could turn any minute, so take a rain coat just in case.';
      break;
    default:
      para.textContent = '';
  }
}

-----------ISSUES WITH UNDEFINED

let number = prompt('what is your favorite number')


if (number == 42) {response ="Yay! That's my favorite too!"
}
else if( number < 42 )
  {
    response= "Eh, that's OK but " + `${+number + 1}` + " would be even better"
  }
else if (number > 42){
    response = "LAME. That number is too large!"
}
Functions-------------------------
A function doesn't need a name if it's turns on by an event, such as a button being clicked on.
we can use two ways to make sure if nothing is given a word comes out, one is variable === undefined, varibale = "no text given"
or alert(variablle ?? "No text given")
most function names start with a verb
expressions have the let = function, declarations have just the function name () {}
--------Writing Clean Code-----------
Important to write code so that you don't need to write any comments. Write as if comments don't exisit. 
Comments are best when we are describing why we are doing something. 
--------Arrays-----------------
Array.isArray(nameofarray) = simimlar to typeOf.
if assigned, pop will give the variable the value of what was popped, while push will give you the new length count. 
splice since it is not used in the[] form, think of 1 as [0]
slice makes a new array, so it needs its own variable, since it doesn't effect the orginal array, slice may seem better. 
slice always slice left of that number it lands, treat these are [0]
