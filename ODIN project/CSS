Increasing padding will increase the size, but increasing the margin will decrease the size. 
padding/margin goes clockwork, top right bottom left. 
em and rem, are relative, based off font size, while absolute are based on resolution (mm and inches) 
adding !imporant, to the end, will make sure it will never be overuled. 
.pink-text {
    color: pink !important;
  }
  variables of css can be done with --(name): color
  use of multiple shadows, separated with a comma. 
     box-shadow:0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);
Positive relative, meaning away from, so a direction of 5px top, means 5px away from the top, so it pushed down more. 
position fixed can be used on images for that cool effect, but remember it works on the NAV bar as well. 
margin of auto causes elements to move center, exerpiment this vs justify content-center.
